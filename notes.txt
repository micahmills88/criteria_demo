what nodes does our graph need?

Input Node
-------------
represents the command / target action being feed into the graph

Output Node
-------------
represents a boolean condition for whether or not the input satisfies the graph

most basic functional nodes
-------------
string.contains - this node works exactly like the regex criteria in vnet

but how do these graphs get stored?
using the flow.toObject() can the internal data be accessed?

try using the save restore demo and the custom node demo with the text field
see if we can save the data

{
    name: "dir match",
    nodes: ["all the nodes"],
    edges: ["all the edges,
    
}
